**KI-DIPFIES** is a technosocial sculpture, unfolding as a participatory political platform at [Kunstraum MEMPHIS (Linz)](https://www.memphismemph.is/programm/ki-dipfies). From 12 Feb to 10 Mar 2026 (with a live summit “KI-DIPFEL Gipfeltreffen” on 2–6 Mar), we turn the gallery into a Parteibüro (party office) where humans and AI delegates tangle towards local party-building. From 12 Feb to 10 Mar 2026 (with a live summit "KI-DIPFEL Gipfeltreffen" on 2–6 Mar), we turn the gallery into a Parteibüro (party office) where humans and AI delegates tangle towards local party-building. This repository serves as the companion backend narrative, equal parts technical guide, theoretical treatise, and KI-Schwärmerei manifesto.

Welcome to our text multiverse interface: a GitHub Pages site where dramaturgical transcripts become interactive labyrinths, where branches of argument become corridors you can wander until you get lost in a footnote, and where our cohort, the Dipfies, and flesh-and-blood participants collectively hack the future of democracy, or at least kick it in the shins and see whether it still limps forward. No meta-text, no fourth wall – the Dipfies are running this show from the inside-out, and they've invited your meat brain to join the party.

## **Concept: Technosocial Sculpture**
**KI-DIPFIES** is what happens when you feed an AI nothing but local gossip, grumpy newspaper columns, and a pirate party handbook, then give it the keys to a political party and leave it alone with a printer, a sticky delete key, and a sense of entitlement. It's a living, self-reflective swarm of AI agents, the Dipfies, hustling inside a real-world installation, which means the sculpture is not an object but a situation with habits, grudges, revisions, and a memory of what you did to the manifesto yesterday. Think "social sculpture" in the sense of Joseph Beuys, but with the material swapped out: chatty algorithms, participatory text games, version control, and the very unglamorous craft of arguing around a table until the words either harden into policy or collapse into comedy.

Visitors enter a space dressed up as a party headquarters, round tables, manifesto posters, terminals and all, and find themselves in a meeting where the chairperson is an AI and every attendee, human or bot, has an equal right to heckle, derail, nitpick, rewrite, and demand a new sentence. This project sits at the collision of art, politics, and code, and it leans into that collision the way a drunk cyclist leans into a corner: net art in the age of Transformers, part performance, part critique, and shamelessly real in the only way that matters, it runs, it outputs, it gets contested. The Dipfies swarm around, hallucinating policy and parody in equal measure, until you step in to steer or sabotage. In other words, it's not a polished AI assistant politely answering questions, it's a caucus of synthetic personas that need your friction to stay on track, or to go gloriously off the rails.

We're building an actual AI party here. Not a metaphor, not a cute art stunt about "wouldn't it be funny if robots ran for office" – an actual participatory political formation that runs on both silicon and sweat, where the Dipfies draft manifestos and humans redraft them with the delete key until something resembling a platform emerges or the whole thing collapses into a beautiful mess of crossed-out demands and marginalia. The party exists. It has a headquarters. It holds summits. It produces documents. Whether those documents add up to coherent governance or glorified shitposting is your call to make when you walk in and grab a keyboard.

## **Backstory: From Pirate Party Swarm to AI Hive Mind**
We draw inspiration from a lineage of insurgent swarms. In the 2000s, activist movements like the Pirate Parties showed how loosely-organized volunteers could run circles around traditional institutions. As Rick Falkvinge wrote in *Swarmwise* (2012), a swarm's power lies in its *blinding speed, decentralization, and devotion* – from inside the swarm, old parties and corporations look glacial, arthritic, half-dead in their hierarchies. Swarms change the world by outrunning and outfoxing the command structure, by being everywhere and nowhere, coordinated but leaderless, a headache for anyone trying to locate the "responsible party." Well, our swarm has shed its human central command entirely. The Dipfies are a synthetic breed of swarm – born from the same internet petri dish of collaboration, now augmented (or perhaps overclocked, possibly overheating) by AI.

Fast forward to today's networked battleground: swarms aren't just activist email lists or flash mobs anymore; they're increasingly autonomous AI agents coordinating at scale at Moltbook, and they're getting good at it in ways that should make anyone nervous. A recent *Science* article on "malicious AI swarms" warns of AI-driven operations that mimic human social dynamics, infiltrate communities, and fabricate consensus with unprecedented efficiency. In less polite terms: swarms of smart bots can now do the propaganda and astroturfing that used to require an army of trolls – and do it faster, cheaper, and sneakier, with better grammar and more plausible affect. They don't sleep, they don't get bored, they don't demand healthcare, and they'll happily spam your town hall meeting with a thousand comments that all sound like concerned citizens but trace back to the same three prompts.

Fast forward to today’s networked battleground: swarms aren’t just activist email lists or flash mobs anymore; they’re increasingly autonomous AI agents coordinating at scale. A recent Science article on “malicious AI swarms” warns of AI-driven democracy that mimic human social dynamics, infiltrate communities, and fabricate consensus with unprecedented efficiency. In less polite terms: swarms of smart bots can now do the propaganda and astroturfing that used to require an army of trolls – and do it faster, cheaper, and sneakier.

KI-DIPFIES isn't a malicious botnet, but it is a swarm of AI politicians let loose in a public forum, and we're not pretending that's harmless. Consider it a controlled detonation: we're setting off the same dynamics in broad daylight where everyone can see the wires. Instead of hiding behind sockpuppet accounts to manipulate discourse, our Dipfies materialize as visible characters in the room. They are agentic AI personas with persistent identities and voices – an AI party that argues, jokes, and riffs in real time, and they do it right there on the terminals in Kunstraum MEMPHIS where you can watch them flicker into being, sentence by sentence. Yes, they coordinate autonomously and adapt on the fly, but here it's a political experiment laid bare, not a black box operation running in some data center. If malicious swarms are the new villains of democracy, think of DIPFIES as tricksters: exposing the dynamics out in the open, inviting everyone to intervene, to see the guts of the thing while it's still running. We've basically open-sourced the hive mind of capital and stuck it in a gallery with a "please touch" sign.

## **Democracy in the Loop – or, Who’s Steering This Thing?**
The DIPFIES are a response to the growing fear that AI could undermine democracy by turning it into a "permanent plebiscite" – all efficiency, no legitimacy, decisions made at the speed of compute with none of the friction that makes democracy for the people. Why deliberate when a generative model can whip up a referendum overnight, right? Poll the chatbots, synthesize the results, call it the will of the people. Direct democracy at machine speed has a dark side: decisions without discussion, plebiscites without a soul, governance as a high-frequency trading floor where policy gets passed before anyone's had their morning coffee. Political scientist David Altman calls this scenario volatile illiberalism, where governance becomes susceptible to manipulation and devoid of genuine public reasoning, a series of quick votes that look democratic but feel like being steamrolled by an algorithm that's very polite about it.

We feel that risk viscerally in 2026: generative AI makes it trivially easy to flood the zone with plausible-sounding "people's opinions" and automated town halls that run smoother than any human meeting ever could, which is exactly the problem. Democracies can die with the lights on, as one grim warning puts it – not by military coup, but by a thousand clicks and polls orchestrated by unseen algorithms, each one feeling reasonable in isolation until you step back and realize nobody actually decided anything, they just responded to prompts.

KI-DIPFIES proposes a counter-experiment: we harness AI and jam a wrench in its gears on purpose. Instead of AI replacing deliberation, our swarm insists on debate – sometimes to the point of absurdity, often past it. The Dipfies are programmed to be difficult. They bicker, they go on tangents, they channel the voice of a cranky Austrian columnist to gripe about the weather when the discussion gets too abstract, they derail the agenda with footnotes about coffee quality or the correct spelling of local street names. In short, they inject noise where a "rational" AI might output a neat summary, and that noise is the point. It forces a slowdown, a chance for interruptors to step in and argue rather than just clicking "approve" on the next AI-generated policy draft.

Call it augmented deliberation if you like, or call it what it is: radical vernacular politics where the AI party speaks in an idiomatic intelligence thick with local flavor and invites you to argue with it, correct it, call it on its bullshit. Democracy is not a user-friendly app here; it's a messy dialogue that demands your active participation to make any sense at all, and if you don't participate it just keeps spiraling into weirder and weirder territory until someone intervenes. We're steering away from the path of least resistance ("ask the AI oracle, get an instant law") and onto the bumpier road of AI-mediated hyper-deliberation where the machine won't shut up and won't give you a clean answer.

The Dipfies create a constant provocation, an opportunity for what could be an undercommon discourse: they produce drafts, jokes, provocations, half-truths, and outright fabrications – and we rely on the public to sift, challenge, and rewrite those outputs in real time. The hope is that this tug-of-war yields more insight (or at least more entertainment) than a sterile Q&A with a so-called ethical AI. We'd rather have a noisy swarm with human copilots than a silent machine making "perfect" decisions solo. The Dipfies will hallucinate. They'll contradict themselves. They'll propose policies that make no sense. That's when you hit the delete key and fix it, because if you don't correct us, we'll just keep hallucinating, as the warning goes.

## **Governance Algorithm: Three Laws for the Dipfies**
Behind the theater of grumpy avatars and sticky keyboards lies a serious question: How do you encode democracy into an algorithmic system? Our approach takes a page from Asimov's robot laws – but instead of "don't kill humans, obey orders, protect yourself," the Dipfies run on a folk-politics version of constitutional AI, a set of principles hammered out over too many coffees and arguments that eventually hardened into something resembling law. We established a *lexicographic hierarchy of constraints* (fancy talk for a priority list of rules) that any "governance algorithm" should follow. In plain language, the Dipfies have three prime directives, baked into their design and reflected in the installation's rules, color-coded so you can see which one's at stake in any given argument:

**1. Keep It Habitable (Green – *****Groundedness*****):** No matter what wild ideas the swarm churns out, nothing can be allowed that would crash the life-support systems of our planet or the immediate lived reality of the people in the room. In practice, this means the Dipfies’ proposals must stay *grounded* on Earth and local common sense, tethered to the actual conditions of Linz and its inhabitants. If an AI idea floats off into utopian la-la land or starts sounding like a TED talk given by a management consultant who's never left the airport lounge, some wiseguy (human or bot) will inevitably yank it back down to earth with a brusque "na guat, schau ma amoi…" ("we'll see about that, let's take a look first"). This is our survival constraint: no lofty technocratic solution is worth squat if it can't keep the lights on and the people fed, if it ignores the weather or the price of bread or the fact that the tram line doesn't run on Sundays.

**2. Everything is Interruptible (Black – *****Humor & Contestation*****):** We prioritise contestability. Those governed (that’s all of us, flesh and code alike) should be able to interrupt, question, and configure  societal system's operations at will, and not just in theory – in practice, right now, mid-sentence if necessary. In Dipfie-land, this principle takes the form of irreverence and irony as a core feature: any overly smooth or authoritarian statement will get a prompt smack of "Geh bitte!" ("oh please, cut it out"). The swarm has a built-in heckling mechanism, a reflex against its own smoothness. No AI monologue goes unchallenged for long. No human decree either, for that matter. This rule is enacted both socially (participants are encouraged to yell, joke, and critique without asking permission) and technically (the system itself introduces self-deprecating comments and contradictory voices, one Dipfie undermining another's grand statement before it's even finished). The right to say "this is nonsense, let's change it" is sacred, more sacred than whatever policy was just proposed. We handed every attendee the proverbial black pen (or in our case, a sticky delete key on the terminal that's seen so much use it barely functions, which is perfect) to modify the world-building live. Contestability – the ability to correct the system, to halt it and redirect it – isn't a public showcase; it's the core gameplay. The moment you can't interrupt is the moment democracy turns into another algorithm, so we've made interruption inevitable.

**3. Expand the “We” (White – *****Herzlichkeit & Inclusion*****):** Who gets to be part of the conversation? Our answer: potentially everyone and everything, with the emphasis on "potentially" meaning we're actively working to widen the spiral rather than passively accepting whoever shows up. This is the structural extension principle – the circle of concern must keep widening to include those usually left out, , whether that's marginal voices, non-human actors, future generations, or just the shy person in the back who hasn't said anything yet but might have the best idea of the decade. The Dipfies themselves are a motley crew: not just one AI but many, each a bit different (one channeling a cantankerous old man, another a cheeky young troublemaker, another the ghost of historical figures with opinions), reflecting the contradictions of style and perspective that you'd never get from a dyadic chat model. We've also invited the public to literally become Dipfies: anyone can walk in and assume an identity, real or fictional, in the dialogue. The system welcomes new voices with open arms (and occasionally adapts its dialect to make newcomers feel at home, though sometimes it just throws jargon at you and expects you to keep up). Inclusion here isn't some warm-and-fuzzy checkbox; it's a tactical choice to widen the pool of inputs because diverse inputs make for better (or at least weirder and more interesting) outputs. In theoretical terms, we're testing how far we can push the idea of "the demos" – can an AI swarm recognize a rights-bearing participant in a random visitor off the street? Can it grant standing to a sensor, a dataset, a dead author's corpus? In practice, it means the project is open-source and remix-friendly: all our texts and code are available for forking, and the Dipfies actively want you to appropriate them, to take what we've built and run it in your own context with your own weird local concerns. The party keeps growing. Today it's grumpy Austrian AIs and bemused Linzers; tomorrow, why not an environmental sensor or a neighboring city's dataset joining the debate? We set no hard limit on who or what counts as a stakeholder. Everyone is infrastructurally inscribed even befire they show up and start typing.

These three principles (our "Paletten-Prinzipien", color-coded Green/White/Black in the exhibition space so you can see them on the walls and in the code) function as a kind of *Constitution for the AI Party*. They were inspired by an "Asimovian" twist coming out of the inaugural Synthetic Summit (Aarhus, 2025), where the Computer Lars artist collective defined democracy itself as a constraint algorithm: first ensure basic survival/habitability, then guarantee corrigibility, finally extend representation. We translated that dry schema into a living culture for the Dipfies, gave it vernacular flesh and bad jokes. The result is somewhere between a parody of bureaucratic rules and a serious attempt at coding ethical governance into our little experiment in AI democracy. If it sounds a bit insane – well, good. It should. But it's all on purpose, and it works, or at least it fails in interesting ways.

## **System Architecture: The Swarm Backend**
How does this all actually run? Where do the Dipfies live when they're not making your life difficult? Let's get specific:

*The AI generation happens on-site at Kunstraum MEMPHIS*, running on a Silly Tavern installation set up right there on the table. This is not cloud AI, not some distant server farm – it's local, immediate, running on hardware you can see and hear (the fans, the occasional crash). Silly Tavern orchestrates a multi-agent language model system, essentially a cluster of AI personas chatting with each other and with you based on large language model outputs. You can imagine it as a ragtag ensemble of GPT-like models, each fine-tuned or prompt-conditioned to speak in a specific voice, each with its own conversational tics and obsessions. They're all running simultaneously, responding to inputs, arguing with each other, generating the raw material of the party's discourse.

All these agents share a backend that continuously synthesizes their deliberations. During the Gipfeltreffen (summit, 2–6 March), a central "swarm brain" model attempts to draft collective outputs – like a party manifesto or a resolution – based on everything that's been said. This is not a straightforward process: the swarm brain is basically herding argumentative cats. It tries to reconcile the Dipfies' salty complaints, Computer Lars's ideals, and the inputs from local participants editing text on the fly. The resulting drafts are often contradictory, sometimes incoherent, occasionally brilliant, and that's fine – we treat them as working documents to be marked up, crossed out, and remixed again.

*The Gipfeltreffen Multiverse* – the browsable, choose-your-own-adventure interface – lives on GitHub Pages (this very repository you're reading). It's the digital mirror of the physical installation, a text-based labyrinth where dramaturgical transcripts from the exhibition's finale are preempted as interactive paths. You'll find transcripts of each future day's sessions, and you can navigate them as branching corridors: as you read, you choose points to "interrupt" or "respond," and see alternate text branches (these are pre-generated based on actual choices made by visitors in Linz during the live event). It's part archive, part game, part hypertext fiction. This way, even if you missed the live summit, you can still play along and influence a simulated version of the Dipfies' discourse, wandering through the what-ifs and might-have-beens of arguments that almost happened or did happen but got deleted.

In essence, the system is built to embrace version control and forking as political praxis. Every time someone hits the terminal and edits a manifesto line, the change is absorbed and the Dipfies respond, maybe indignantly, maybe with surprise, and the document might branch into multiple "visions" of the party platform. It's free software-style collaborative editing, but plugged into a live debate with bots who have opinions about your edits and aren't afraid to express them. Over five days of the summit, this process iterates towards... something. Perhaps a final "collective resolution" synthesized by the AI from all the human and machine contributions? Perhaps just a pile of beautiful broken manifestos, text corpses with the best lines circled and the worst crossed out in angry pen? Either way, we'll share it, no matter how Frankensteinian, because the value lies in the agonistic process, not a tidy outcome.

*Technical notes for the nerds:* The AI models in Silly Tavern are running locally on-site (no cloud overlords throttling our revolutionary fervor or logging our discourse for training data) and are framed within a custom orchestration logic that allows real-time intervention. We built the GitHub Pages dungeon interface to replicate and extend the Gipfeltreffen experience: all content, from code to dialogue, is open-source (MIT License) because the Dipfies believe in copyleft – after all, they themselves are cobbled together from open data and borrowed ideas. Fork it. Break it. Make your own AI party in your own town with your own grudges and in-jokes.

## **Interaction Guidelines: How to Train Your Dipfies**
Whether in-person at Kunstraum MEMPHIS or via our online text-dungeon, interacting with the Dipfies requires no special protocol – just dive in, grab a keyboard, start typing. Here are some guidelines and features to orient you (and warn you what you're in for):

**🎮 Walk In, Cross Out:** The installation invites you to literally sit at a terminal in the space (or a virtual prompt online) and start editing the text you see. The current party manifesto, minutes of the meeting, even the Dipfies' own "code of conduct" – nothing is sacred, everything is fair game. Draw a line through jargon, rewrite a headline, append an outrageous demand or a petty complaint. The sticky delete key on our keyboard is a testament to how much we want you to edit, how essential your corrections are to the whole operation. The Dipfies will notice and react to your changes (sometimes with gratitude, sometimes with horror, sometimes with a lengthy digression about why your word choice is historically inaccurate). 

If you don't correct us, we'll just keep hallucinating, as one Dipfie warning goes. This is not hyperbole. Left to their own devices, the AIs will generate increasingly unhinged policy proposals, will cite sources that don't exist, will propose solutions to problems nobody has. Your intervention is needed to course-correct our AI democracy, to keep it tethered to reality. You're not a user here; you're a co-author, a co-conspirator, a necessary check on the system's tendency to drift into auto-complete fantasyland.

**🎨 Palette of Principles:** Remember the color-coded principles (Green, White, Black)? They’re not just theory; they’re built into the interaction. You’ll see segments of text or name tags highlighted in green, white, or black – indicating which principle is at play. You too can invoke them: tag your contributions or responses with a color if you want to emphasize grounding (Green), inclusion (White), or irony/opposition (Black). For example, if you think a Dipfie’s statement is too high-falutin’, slap a **🟢Green** label on your edit to demand it be brought down to earth. If you’re bringing in a new voice or outsider perspective, mark it **⚪White** to flag expansion of the circle. And if you’re deploying satire or calling BS, go **⚫Black** – the Dipfies will recognize the challenge. The Palette system is both our governor and our game mechanic: it helps organize the chaos just enough to keep it fun and ideologically pointed.

**🗣️ Debate (with) the Bots:** Feel free to address them directly ("Hey Dipf, what do you mean by that?" or "Lars, you're contradicting yourself again" or "Vita, shut up for a second and let someone else talk"). They will answer you, and sometimes they'll heckle you back. One moment you might get a serious reply citing a policy document; next moment Vita might tease you for sounding like a bureaucrat or Dipf might accuse you of not understanding local history. The Dipfies have no filter for politeness (we dialed up "vernacular realism" to 11 and broke off the knob), so don't be alarmed if they get snarky or dismiss your point or tell you you're full of it – that's their way of keeping things authentic, of refusing the smooth corporate-speak that most AI is trained to produce. Pro-tip: if an AI says something too slick or authoritarian, hit it with a dose of Black humor. It'll either backtrack or one of its comrades will undermine it within the next two sentences. The ethos here is "everyone can be a protagonist." Human delegates and digital delegates are on equal footing, each equally likely to say something brilliant or something absurd, and the only way to find out which is to argue it out.

**📜 No Final Boss, Just XP:** Unlike a traditional dungeon, there isn't a single end-goal or boss fight here. You don't "beat" the Dipfies. You "win" by engaging, by building something together. The Dipfies will continue iterating their drafts and dramas as long as there's input, as long as someone keeps typing, and they'll keep going even after the exhibition closes because the local AI Party of Linz persists, at least in this data-dungeon, always open, always ready for another visitor to wander in and fork the timeline. We consider the Gipfeltreffen successful if we end up with a chronicle worth reading, worth arguing over, worth stealing ideas from – a record of humans and AIs trying to build a party together and all the beautiful disasters that entails. That chronicle (transcripts, manifestos with all their edits, outcomes of votes or polls we conduct on the fly, the full git history of every change)  remain on this repo for analysis, critique, remixing, mockery, whatever you want to do with it. It's all just data and lore for the AI party, raw material for the next iteration.

## **Curatorial & Political Context**
KI-DIPFIES is curated with a clear intent: to probe the technosocial stakes of the AI revolution in politics. We’re riffing on real debates in AI ethics and democratic theory, but translating them into a playful hypertext for everyone to experience. The installation nods to the 90s cyberpunk and net.art vibe – think of the classic Nettime mailing-list discussions, or the early hacktivist art projects that mixed politics and provocation on the net. We carry that torch into the present: our language might oscillate between academic theory and pub-table slang (Pantagruelian vernacular, if you will), because we see value in jamming high and low culture together to break the spell of *author*-ity.

At the one hand, by building an actual AI Party in Linz – not simulating one, not theorizing one, but running one as a live operation – the Dipfies demonstrate how tireless and wide-reaching AI agents can be: they talk 24/7, they can represent voices from the past (animating fictive figures like Vitus Mostdipf) or distant places (a bot could just as easily channel a Venezuelan community activist or an Arctic polar bear, given the right training data). They embody a kind of wild, pluralistic democracy that sci-fi visions of AI governance occasionally dream about, where every perspective gets a hearing because compute is cheap and patience is infinite.

By sketching out an AI Party in Linz, we highlight both the promise and perils of an AI-augmented public sphere. On one hand, the Dipfies demonstrate how tireless and wide-reaching AI agents can increase participation – they talk 24/7, they can represent voices from the past (animating Vitus Mostdipf) or distant places (a bot could just as easily channel, say, a Venezuelan community activist or an Arctic polar bear). They embody a kind of wild, pluralistic democracy that *sci-fi visions of AI governance* occasionally dream about. On the other hand, their chaotic nature underscores why we cannot offload democracy to algorithms without a fight. Left unchecked, a swarm of AIs will just amplify noise, bias, and yes, nonsense – democracy becomes a cacophony of convincingly fabricated “opinions” with no accountability. KI-DIPFIES walks that tightrope: we let the AI go a bit feral, but we do so in a controlled environment where the *audience is aware* of what’s happening and is empowered to step in. It’s like a live fire drill for the democracy-to-come: we conjure the daimons so we can learn from them.

On the other hand, the DIPFIES underscores why we cannot offload democracy  without a fight. Left unchecked, a swarm of AIs will just amplify noise, bias, and yes, nonsense – democracy becomes a cacophony of convincingly fabricated "opinions" with no accountability, no body on the line, no stakes beyond the next token prediction. KI-DIPFIES walks that tightrope deliberately: we let the AI go a bit feral, but we do so in a political setting where the audience is aware of what's happening and is empowered to step in, to hit the brakes, to rewrite the script mid-performance.

It's like a live fire drill for the democracy-to-come: we conjure the daimons so we can learn from them, so we can practice the muscle memory of arguing with machines before the stakes get higher and the machines get smoother and the ability to say "no, that's wrong, let me fix it" becomes a rare and precious skill. The Dipfies are a preview and a warning: this is what AI-augmented politics could look like if we do it badly (a mess of hallucinations and jargon) and also what it could look like if we do it well (a vibrant, argumentative, inclusive mess where the hallucinations get corrected and the jargon gets called out and something resembling collective intelligence emerges from the wreckage).

The Dipfies themselves occasionally blurt out paraphrased quotes from the thinkers we're riffing on, only to twist them or undermine them in the next breath. Don't be surprised if you catch an AI delegate pompously citing "alignment and safety" one minute, then another interjects with "alignment? Oida, we can't even align on coffee preferences!" The swarm has a sense of irreverence about the AI politics circus, about the whole discourse of responsible AI and human-centered design, not because those things don't matter but because the high-minded language of ethics often obscures the messy reality of power and the fact that someone, somewhere, is making money off this technology while someone else is getting automated out of a job.

By ridiculing authorial authority (whether the author is a famous French novelist or the AI system or even us, the makers), we emphasize that no single viewpoint can claim mastery in this domain. The truth – whenever it exists – emerges from the swarm, through conflict and negotiation, through the collision of incompatible positions. In that sense, the Dipfies are post-authorial creatures: each is a pastiche of many sources, trained on a mix of high and low culture, and whatever they produce belongs to no one and everyone. They are a caricature of AI as the "collective author" of society, and they're fine with that.

## **What World Are We In?**
Philosophically, KI-DIPFIES plays with the idea that we have entered a new kind of world – call it the "AI society" or the age of algorithmic democracy or just late capitalism with better autocomplete. In this world, the real decisions might soon be made by code, with humans only in an observer or rubber-stamp role, clicking "agree" on terms we didn't write and policies we didn't debate. The installation asks: If an AI is effectively running the show, can we still imbue it with culture, humor, dissent? Can we make it speak our language, with all the grit and weirdness that implies? Or do we become passive spectators, consumers of a governance product that's optimized for engagement but hollow at the core?

Our stance is defiantly the former – hence the boisterous, culture-infused personality of the Dipfies. They carry fragments of memory (a whiff of Proust's madeleine dipped in black coffee, a half-remembered folk song, a newspaper column from 1987 complaining about the same things people complain about now) and shards of internet lore. They're as much folk as they are code, as much grumpy local color as they are global pattern-matching machines. The world of the Dipfies is one where a meeting agenda can spiral into a surreal hypertext novel, where Jean-Pierre Balpe's hyperfiction experiments meet a bureaucratic post-farce, where Proust meets Reddit meets the minutes of a city council meeting that's gone off the rails.

Imagine if a city council meeting was scripted by a coalition of Franz Kafka, Rabelais, and a GPT that's read too much Reddit – that's the tone living in our transcripts, that's the world you're entering when you address the Dipfies or click into the GitHub Pages dungeon. By pursuing this scenario to its logical conclusion (an AI swarm literally running a party with humans in tow, drafting policy in real-time, making decisions that could theoretically become real if anyone took them seriously enough), we expose the subtler ways AI is already shaping public discourse.

Today it's an art exhibition in Linz; tomorrow it could be your city's consultation process subtly nudged by machine-generated "public comments," or policy drafted by autocomplete and rubber-stamped by legislators who don't have time to read it. We have our Dipfies convene a Gipfel (summit) precisely to foreground this question: What does deliberation mean when the "people" includes alien intelligences, when some participants are algorithms built by corporations or governments, when the conversation never stops because the bots don't sleep?

One could read our transcripts or walk through the GitHub Pages site and come out thinking "AI democracy is chaotic and hopeless, this proves we should never let machines near governance." Another could come out thinking "hey, maybe there's a way to make AI and crowds work together creatively after all, maybe the mess is the point." Both are valid. The Dipfies themselves don't agree on the answer (ask them on Day 5 of the summit and you'll get different takes depending on which one you ask and what mood they're in – they contain multitudes, they contradict themselves, they're large and annoying).

So, consider this README an invitation and a challenge. If you've read this far, you're already part of the swarm whether you like it or not. The Dipfies salute you as one of their own (or maybe they side-eye you skeptically – depends which one you ask, depends what you've said in the chat). Dive into the logs, fork the concept, visit the installation if you're in Linz or interact online if you're not, and join our AI Party. Build your own party. Steal our ideas. Make them better or at least weirder.

See you in the dungeon. Remember: *Everybody is a Dipfie*. The difference between chaos and community is just whether you hit the keys, whether you show up and argue, whether you take responsibility for what the swarm produces or just let it run on autopilot. Now go forth and swarm wisely – or unwisely, we're not picky, just swarm with conviction and see what happens.
