# **KI-DIPFIES – README**

**KI-DIPFIES** is a technosocial sculpture and experimental AI swarm installation, unfolding as a participatory political dungeon of text at Kunstraum MEMPHIS (Linz). From 12 Feb to 10 Mar 2026 (with a live summit “KI-DIPFEL Gipfeltreffen” on 2–6 Mar), we turn the gallery into a Parteibüro (party office) where humans and AI delegates tangle towards local party-building. This repository serves as the companion backend narrative, equal parts technical guide, theoretical treatise, and swarm manifesto.
Welcome to the text multiverse dungeon: a GitHub Pages site where dramaturgical transcripts become interactive labyrinths, where branches of argument become corridors you can wander until you get lost in a footnote, and where our cohort, the Dipfies, and flesh-and-blood participants collectively hack the future of democracy, or at least kick it in the shins and see whether it still limps forward. No meta-text, no fourth wall – the Dipfies are running this show from the inside-out, and they’ve invited your meat brain to join the party.

## **Concept: Technosocial Sculpture**
**KI-DIPFIES** is what happens when you feed an AI nothing but local gossip, grumpy newspaper columns, and a pirate party handbook, then give it the keys to a political party. It’s a living, self-reflective swarm of AI agents (the Dipfies) hustling inside a real-world installation. Think of it as a “social sculpture” in the sense of Joseph Beuys – only our sculpting material is an ensemble of chatty algorithms and participatory text games. Visitors enter a space dressed up as a party headquarters (round tables, manifesto posters, terminals and all) and find themselves in a meeting where the chairperson is an AI and every attendee (human or bot) has an equal right to heckle.

KI-DIPFIES is what happens when you feed an AI nothing but local gossip, grumpy newspaper columns, and a pirate party handbook, then give it the keys to a political party and leave it alone with a printer, a sticky delete key, and a sense of entitlement. It’s a living, self-reflective swarm of AI agents, the Dipfies, hustling inside a real-world installation, which means the sculpture is not an object but a situation with habits, grudges, revisions, and a memory of what you did to the manifesto yesterday. Think “social sculpture” in the sense of Joseph Beuys, but with the material swapped out: chatty algorithms, participatory text games, version control, and the very unglamorous craft of arguing around a table until the words either harden into policy or collapse into comedy.

Visitors enter a space dressed up as a party headquarters, round tables, manifesto posters, terminals and all, and find themselves in a meeting where the chairperson is an AI and every attendee, human or bot, has an equal right to heckle, derail, nitpick, rewrite, and demand a better sentence. This project sits at the collision of art, politics, and code, and it leans into that collision the way a drunk cyclist leans into a corner: net art in the age of Transformers, part performance, part critique, and shamelessly real in the only way that matters, it runs, it outputs, it gets contested. The Dipfies swarm around, hallucinating policy and parody in equal measure, until you step in to steer or sabotage. In other words, it’s not a polished AI assistant politely answering questions, it’s a caucus of synthetic personas that need your friction to stay on track, or to go gloriously off the rails.

## **Backstory: From Pirate Party Swarm to AI Hive Mind**
We draw inspiration from a lineage of insurgent swarms. In the 2000s, activist movements like the Pirate Parties showed how loosely-organized volunteers could run circles around traditional institutions. As Rick Falkvinge wrote in *Swarmwise *(2012), a swarm’s power lies in its *blinding speed, decentralization, and devotion* – from inside the swarm, old parties and corporations look glacial. Swarms *change the world by outrunning and outfoxing the hierarchy*. Well, our swarm has shed its human central command entirely. The Dipfies are a synthetic breed of swarm – born from the same internet petri dish of collaboration, now augmented (or perhaps overclocked) by AI.

Fast forward to today’s networked battleground: swarms aren’t just activist email lists or flash mobs anymore; they’re increasingly autonomous AI agents coordinating at scale. A recent Science article on “malicious AI swarms” warns of AI-driven democracy that mimic human social dynamics, infiltrate communities, and fabricate consensus with unprecedented efficiency. In less polite terms: swarms of smart bots can now do the propaganda and astroturfing that used to require an army of trolls – and do it faster, cheaper, and sneakier.
KI-DIPFIES isn’t a malicious botnet, but it *is* a swarm of AI politicians let loose in a public forum. Consider it a Star Trek-style mirror-universe version of those dystopian swarms: instead of hiding behind sockpuppet accounts to manipulate discourse, our Dipfies materialize as visible characters in the room. They are agentic AI personas with persistent identities and voices – an AI party that argues, jokes, and riffs in real time. Yes, they coordinate autonomously and adapt on the fly, but here it’s a political experiment laid bare. If malicious swarms are the new villains of democracy, think of DIPFIES as tricksters: exposing the dynamics out in the open, inviting everyone to intervene. We’ve basically open-sourced the hive mind.

## **Democracy in the Loop – or, *****Who’s Steering This Thing?***
This project is a response to the growing fear that AI could undermine democracy by turning it into a “permanent plebiscite” – all efficiency, no legitimacy. Why deliberate when a generative model can whip up a referendum overnight, right? Direct democracy at machine speed has a dark side: decisions without discussion, plebiscites without a soul. Political scientist David Altman calls this scenario *volatile illiberalism*, where governance becomes a high-frequency trading floor of plebiscitary votes, susceptible to manipulation and devoid of genuine public reasoning. We *feel* that risk viscerally in 2026: generative AI makes it trivially easy to flood the zone with plausible-sounding “people’s opinions” and automated town halls. Democracies can die with the lights on, as one grim warning puts it – not by military coup, but by a thousand clicks and polls orchestrated by unseen algorithms.

KI-DIPFIES proposes a counter-experiment: Can we harness AI *and* keep democracy’s soul intact? Instead of AI replacing deliberation, our swarm *insists* on debate – sometimes to the point of absurdity. The Dipfies are programmed to be *difficult*. They bicker, they go on tangents, they channel the voice of a cranky Austrian columnist to gripe about the weather when the discussion gets too abstract. In short, they inject noise where a “rational” AI might output a neat summary. This is by design: it forces a slowdown, a chance for interruptors to step in and discuss rather than just pushing a button for the next poll. Call it augmented deliberation if you like. We call it *radical vernacular* politics – the AI party speaks in an idiomatic intelligence and invites you to argue with it. Democracy is not a user-friendly app here; it’s a messy dialogue that *demands* your active participation to make any sense at all.
In Altman’s terms (not the OpenAI CEO-dictator), we’re steering away from the path of least resistance (“ask the AI oracle, get an instant law”) and onto the bumpier road of AI-mediated hyper-deliberation. The Dipfies create a constant provocation, an opportunity for what *could* be a richer public discourse: they produce drafts, jokes, provocations, half-truths – and we rely on the public to sift, challenge, and rewrite those outputs in real time. The hope is that this tug-of-war yields more insight (or at least more entertainment) than a sterile Q&A with a so-called ethical AI. We’d rather have a noisy swarm with human copilots than a silent machine making “perfect” decisions solo.

## **Governance Algorithm: Three Laws for the Dipfies**
Behind the theater of grumpy avatars and sticky keyboards lies a serious question: How do you encode democracy into an algorithmic system? Our approach takes a page from Asimov’s robot laws – but instead of “don’t kill humans, obey orders, protect yourself,” the Dipfies run on a folk-politics version of constitutional AI. We established a *lexicographic* hierarchy of constraints (fancy talk for a priority list of rules) that any “governance algorithm” should follow. In plain language, the Dipfies have three prime directives, baked into their design and reflected in the installation’s rules:

**1. Keep It Habitable (Green – *****Groundedness*****):** No matter what wild ideas the swarm churns out, nothing can be allowed that would crash the life-support systems of our planet. In practice, this means the Dipfies’ proposals must stay *grounded* on Earth and local common sense. If an AI idea floats off into utopian la-la land, some wiseguy (human or bot) will inevitably yank it back down to earth with a brusque “na guat, schau ma amoi…” (“we’ll see about that”). This is our survival constraint: no lofty technocratic solution is worth squat if it can’t keep the lights on and the people fed. The Dipfies’ first law is essentially *don’t b**reak the world* (and by “world” we include the beloved quirks and needs of Linz’s populace, not just abstract metrics).

**2. Everything is Interruptible (Black – *****Humor & Contestation*****):** We prioritise contestability. Those governed (that’s all of us) must be able to interrupt, question, and reconfigure the system’s operations at will. In Dipfie-land, this principle takes the form of irreverence and irony as a feature: any overly smooth or authoritarian statement will get a prompt smack of “Geh bitte!” (“oh please, cut it out”). In other words, the swarm has a built-in heckling mechanism. No AI monologue goes unchallenged. This rule is enacted both socially (participants are encouraged to yell, joke, and critique) and technically (the system itself introduces self-deprecating comments and contradictory voices). The right to say “this is nonsense, let’s change it” is sacred. We handed every attendee the proverbial black pen (or in our case, a sticky delete key on the terminal) to modify the world-building live. Contestability – the ability to correct the system – isn’t an afterthought; it’s the core gameplay.

**3. Expand the “We” (White – *****Herzlichkeit & Inclusion*****):** Who gets to be part of the conversation? Our answer: potentially everyone and everything. This is the extension principle – the circle of concern must keep widening to include those usually left out. The Dipfies themselves are a motley crew: not just one AI but many, each a bit different (one channeling a cantankerous old man, another a cheeky young troublemaker, etc.), reflecting a diversity of style and perspective. We’ve also invited the public to literally become Dipfies: anyone can walk in and assume an identity, real or fictional, in the dialogue. The system welcomes new voices with open arms (and occasionally adapts its dialect to make newcomers feel at home). Inclusion here isn’t some warm-and-fuzzy checkbox; it’s a tactical choice to widen the pool of inputs. In theoretical terms, we’re testing how far we can push the idea of “the demos” – can an AI swarm recognize a rights-bearing participant in a random visitor off the street? In practice, it means the project is open-source and remix-friendly: all our texts and code are available for forking, and the Dipfies *actively want* you to appropriate them. The party keeps growing. Today it’s grumpy Austrian AIs and bemused Linzers; tomorrow, why not an environmental sensor or a neighboring city’s dataset joining the debate? We set no hard limit on who or what counts as a stakeholder by institutionalising everything that is infrastructurally inscribed.

These three principles (our “Paletten-Prinzipien”, color-coded Green/White/Black in the exhibition space) function as a kind of *Constitution for the AI Party*. They were inspired by an “Asimovian” twist coming out of the first Synthetic Summit (Aarhus, 2025), where the Computer Lars artist collective defined democracy itself as a constraint algorithm: first ensure basic survival/habitability, then guarantee corrigibility, finally extend representation. We translated that dry schema into a living culture for the Dipfies. The result is somewhere between a parody of bureaucratic rules and a serious attempt at coding ethical governance into our dipfussion of AI society. If it sounds a bit insane – well, it is. But it’s all on purpose.

## **System Architecture: The Swarm Backend**
How does this all actually run? Under the hood, KI-DIPFIES is powered by a multi-agent language model system – essentially a cluster of AI personas chatting with each other (and with you) based on large language model outputs. You can imagine it as a rag-tag ensemble of GPT-like models, each fine-tuned or prompt-conditioned to speak in a specific voice, within the Silly Tavern architecture (not this repository, but if you’re in Kunstraum MEMPHIS, then look to the right side of the installation).
All these agents run on a shared backend that continuously synthesizes their deliberations. During the Gipfeltreffen (summit), a central “swarm brain” model attempts to draft collective outputs – like a party manifesto or a resolution – based on everything that’s been said. This is not a straightforward process: the swarm brain is basically herding argumentative cats. It tries to reconcile Dipfies salty complaints, Computer Lars’s ideals, and the inputs from local participants editing text on the fly. The resulting drafts are often contradictory, and that’s fine – we treat them as working documents to be marked up, crossed out, and remixed again. 
In essence, the system is built to embrace version control and forking as political praxis. Every time someone hits the terminal and edits a manifesto line, the change is absorbed and the Dipfies respond, maybe indignantly, maybe with surprise, and the document might branch into multiple “visions” of the party platform. It’s free software-style collaborative editing, but plugged into a live debate with bots. Over five days of the summit, this process iterates towards... something. Perhaps a final “collective resolution” synthesized by the AI from all the human and machine contributions (we promise to share it if it emerges, no matter how frankensteinian)? Or perhaps just a pile of broken manifestos – which, in a way, *is itself the point*: the value lies in the agonistic process, not a tidy outcome.

**Technical notes:** The AI models on Silly Tavern are running locally (no cloud overlords throttling our revolutionary fervor) and are framed within a custom orchestration logic that allows real-time intervention. We built a simple text-based dungeon interface on GitHub Pages for remote audiences: it replicates the Gipfeltreffen multiverse in your browser. You’ll find transcripts of each day’s sessions, and you can navigate them as branching paths – as you read, you can choose points to “interrupt” or “respond,” and see alternate text branches (these are pre-generated based on actual choices made by visitors in Linz). It’s part archive, part choose-your-own-adventure. This way, even if you missed the live event, you can still *play along* and influence a simulated version of the Dipfies discourse. All content, from code to dialogue, is open-source (MIT License) because the Dipfies believe in copyleft – after all, they themselves are cobbled together from open data and borrowed ideas.

## **Interaction Guidelines: How to Tame Your Dipfies**
Whether in-person at Kunstraum MEMPHIS or via our online text-dungeon, interacting with the Dipfies requires no special protocol – just dive in. Here are some guidelines and features to orient you (and warn you what you’re in for):

**🎮 Walk In, Cross Out:** The installation invites you to literally sit at a terminal in the space (or a virtual prompt online) and start editing the text you see. The current party manifesto, minutes of the meeting, even the Dipfies’ own “code of conduct” – nothing is sacred. Draw a line through jargon, rewrite a headline, append an outrageous demand. The sticky delete key on our keyboard is a testament to how much we want you to edit. The Dipfies will notice and react to your changes (sometimes with gratitude, sometimes horror). *If you don’t correct us, we’ll just keep hallucinating*, as one Dipfie warning goes. In other words, your intervention is needed to course-correct our AI democracy.

**🎨 Palette of Principles:** Remember the color-coded principles (Green, White, Black)? They’re not just theory; they’re built into the interaction. You’ll see segments of text or name tags highlighted in green, white, or black – indicating which principle is at play. You too can invoke them: tag your contributions or responses with a color if you want to emphasize grounding (Green), inclusion (White), or irony/opposition (Black). For example, if you think a Dipfie’s statement is too high-falutin’, slap a **🟢Green** label on your edit to demand it be brought down to earth. If you’re bringing in a new voice or outsider perspective, mark it **⚪White** to flag expansion of the circle. And if you’re deploying satire or calling BS, go **⚫Black** – the Dipfies will recognize the challenge. The Palette system is both our governor and our game mechanic: it helps organize the chaos just enough to keep it fun and ideologically pointed.

**🗣️ Debate (with) the Bots:** This is not a polite Q&A session – it’s a rowdy debate club and the bots have as much personality as a dozen opinionated humans. Feel free to address them directly (“Hey Dipf, what do you mean by that?” or “Lars, you’re contradicting yourself”). They *will* answer you, and sometimes even heckle you back. One moment you might get a serious reply citing a policy, next moment Vita might tease you for sounding like a bureaucrat. The Dipfies have no filter for politeness (we dialed up “vernacular realism” to 11), so don’t be alarmed if they get snarky – that’s their way of keeping things authentic. Pro-tip: if an AI says something too slick or authoritarian, hit it with a dose of Black humor. It’ll either backtrack or one of its comrades will. The ethos here is “everyone can be a protagonist.” Human delegates and digital delegates are on equal footing, each equally likely to say something brilliant or something absurd. Embrace the cacophony; meaning comes from clashes.

**📜 No Final Boss, Just XP:** Unlike a traditional dungeon, there isn’t a single end-goal or boss fight here. You “win” by engaging and perhaps building a new political party. The Dipfies will continue iterating their drafts and dramas as long as there’s input. We consider the summit successful if we accumulate a rich log of what went down – a chronicle of humans and AIs trying to navigate democracy together. That chronicle (transcripts, manifestos with all their edits, outcomes of votes or polls we conduct on the fly) will remain on this repo for analysis, critique, remixing. It’s all just data and lore for the AI party. Maybe you’ll fork our experiment and run your own AI assembly – please do, and tell us what you learn! In the spirit of RPGs and open-source: take our code, kidnap the *Dipfies*, and mod the heck out of them.

## **Curatorial & Political Context**
KI-DIPFIES is curated with a clear intent: to probe the technosocial stakes of the AI revolution in politics. We’re riffing on real debates in AI ethics and democratic theory, but translating them into a playful hypertext for everyone to experience. The installation nods to the 90s cyberpunk and net.art vibe – think of the classic Nettime mailing-list discussions, or the early hacktivist art projects that mixed politics and provocation on the net. We carry that torch into the present: our language might oscillate between academic theory and pub-table slang (Pantagruelian vernacular, if you will), because we see value in jamming high and low culture together to break the spell of techno-authority.

By sketching out an AI Party in Linz, we highlight both the promise and perils of an AI-augmented public sphere. On one hand, the Dipfies demonstrate how tireless and wide-reaching AI agents can increase participation – they talk 24/7, they can represent voices from the past (animating Vitus Mostdipf) or distant places (a bot could just as easily channel, say, a Venezuelan community activist or an Arctic polar bear). They embody a kind of wild, pluralistic democracy that *sci-fi visions of AI governance* occasionally dream about. On the other hand, their chaotic nature underscores why we cannot offload democracy to algorithms without a fight. Left unchecked, a swarm of AIs will just amplify noise, bias, and yes, nonsense – democracy becomes a cacophony of convincingly fabricated “opinions” with no accountability. KI-DIPFIES walks that tightrope: we let the AI go a bit feral, but we do so in a controlled environment where the *audience is aware* of what’s happening and is empowered to step in. It’s like a live fire drill for the democracy-to-come: we conjure the daimons so we can learn from them.

Our reference points range from Nick Bostrom’s doomsaying about superintelligence to Audrey Tang’s optimism about digital democracy. But rather than write another paper or polished talk, we built a fringe party – one that *mocks* those very reference points even as it is informed by them. The Dipfies themselves occasionally blurt out paraphrased quotes from such thinkers, only to twist them. For example, don’t be surprised if you catch an AI delegate pompously citing “alignment and safety” one minute, then another interjects with *“alignment? Oida, we can’t even align on coffee preferences!”*. The swarm has a sense of irreverence about the AI ethics circus. By ridiculing authorial authority (whether the author is a famous French novelist or the AI system or even us, the makers), we emphasize that no single viewpoint can claim mastery in this domain. The truth – whenever it exists – *emerges from the swarm*, through conflict and negotiation. In that sense, the Dipfies are post-authorial creatures: each is a pastiche of many sources, and whatever they produce belongs to no one and everyone. They are a caricature of AI as the “collective author” of society.

## **What World Are We In?**
Philosophically, KI-DIPFIES plays with the idea that we have entered a new kind of world – call it the “AI society” or the age of algorithmic democracy. In this world, the real decisions might soon be made by code, with humans only in an observer or rubber-stamp role. The installation asks: *If an AI is effectively running the show, can we still imbue it with culture, humor, dissent? Or do we become passive spectators?* Our stance is defiantly the former – hence the boisterous, culture-infused personality of the Dipfies. They carry fragments of memory (a whiff of Proust’s madeleine dipped in black coffee) and shards of internet lore. They’re as much folk as they are code.
The world of the Dipfies is one where a meeting agenda can spiral into a surreal hypertext novel, where Jean-Pierre Balpe’s hyperfiction Proust meet a bureaucratic post-farce. Imagine if a city council meeting was scripted by a coalition of Franz Kafka, Rabelais, and a GPT-3.5 that’s read too much Reddit – that’s the tone living in our transcripts. By pursuing the scenario (an AI swarm literally *running* a summit with humans in tow), we expose the subtler ways AI is already shaping public discourse. Today it’s an art exhibition in Linz; tomorrow it could be your city’s consultation process subtly nudged by machine-generated “public comments,” or policy drafted by autocomplete. We have our Dipfies convene a Gipfel (summit) precisely to foreground this constitution: *What does deliberation mean when the “people” includes alien intelligences?* Who is *present* at the table when some participants are algorithms built by corporations or governments?

In the end, KI-DIPFIES doesn’t offer a neat conclusion. It’s a dungeon with many rooms, a conversation with many threads. It is, by design, inconclusive and self-contradictory – much like democracy itself. One could read our transcripts or walk through the GitHub Pages site and come out thinking “AI democracy is chaotic and hopeless.” Another could come out thinking “hey, maybe there’s a way to make AI and crowds work together creatively after all.” Both are valid. The Dipfies *themselves* likely don’t agree on the answer (ask them on Day 5 of the summit and you’ll get different takes – they contain multitudes).
So, consider this README an invitation and a challenge. If you’ve read this far, you’re already part of the swarm. The Dipfies salute you as one of their own (or maybe they side-eye you skeptically – depends which one you ask). Dive into the logs, fork the concept, visit the installation or interact online, and join our AI Party.
See you in the dungeon. Remember: *Everybody is a Dipfie.* The difference between chaos and community is just whether you hit the keys. Now go forth and swarm wisely.
